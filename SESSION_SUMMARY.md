## Issues Fixed During Development

### 1. Supabase SQL Error
**Problem:** `ERROR: 42501: must be owner of table users`  
**Solution:** Removed `ALTER TABLE auth.users` - Supabase manages this table internally

### 2. Tailwind CSS Version Conflict
**Problem:** Tailwind v4 uses different configuration  
**Solution:** Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3 for stability

### 3. TypeScript Import Errors
**Problem:** `verbatimModuleSyntax` requires type-only imports  
**Solution:** Updated all type imports to use `import type` syntax

### 4. Timer UX Issue
**Problem:** Users could accidentally reset timer by clicking duration buttons  
**Solution:** Hide duration presets once timer starts

### 5. No Exit Option
**Problem:** Users couldn't leave Focus mode without completing task  
**Solution:** Added "Cancel Session" button

### 6. No Completion History
**Problem:** No way to see completed tasks  
**Solution:** Built comprehensive Completed Tasks page with stats and delete functionality

## Final Notes

### What Works Well
✨ Clean, minimalist UI that stays out of the way  
✨ Smooth animations that enhance UX

### What Could Be Better
🔧 Mobile responsiveness (desktop-only currently)  
🔧 No offline mode  
🔧 Limited analytics  
🔧 Basic task management (no editing)  
🔧 No recurring tasks  

### Lessons Learned
1. Start with proper database schema planning
2. Supabase RLS requires careful policy setup
